# NFL Age and Performance Analysis Summary

## Introduction
The study explores the correlation between age and player performance in the National Football League (NFL) from 2014 to 2022. By using Fantasy Points as a proxy for performance, the analysis aims to determine when players are at their peak and when they experience a decline due to age. The insights gained can guide team front offices in drafting players to optimize performance.

## Data Collection and Cleaning
Player performance data was sourced from FantasyPros.com, with Madden data from Maddenratings.weebly.com and age data from pro-football-reference.com. Extensive cleaning involved categorizing positions, calculating percentile grades, and merging offensive and defensive player data.

## Key Findings:
### Quarterbacks
- Experienced quarterbacks, around 32 or 38 years old, showcase optimal performance.
- Small sample size of 40+ year old quarterbacks inflates the graph.

### Running Backs
- Running backs' value decreases after the early twenties, making them ideal additions near last in team building.

### Wide Receivers
- Wide receivers peak at ages 20 or 31, with a sharp decline after 35.

### Tight Ends
- Tight ends perform best around age 33, with a significant performance drop after 35.

### Offensive Tackles, Guards, Centers
- Offensive linemen's performance generally increases with age, peaking in their 30s.

### Defensive Tackles, Defensive Ends
- Defensive tackles' performance remains stable until the mid-30s, while defensive ends experience an uptick past 35 and a decline after 38.

### Linebackers, Safeties, Defensive Backs
- Linebackers perform well in their mid-twenties and experience a resurgence around age 30. Safeties show optimal performance after their 30s.

### Kickers
- Kickers can play well into their 40s, with marginal performance differences between players in their 20s and 30s.

## Team Building Strategy
- Drafting order recommendations based on position maturity: Quarterbacks and Offensive Linemen early, followed by other positions in a strategic timeline.

## Limitations and Future Research
- Survivorship bias, validity of Fantasy points as a performance proxy, and the need for more seasons of data are acknowledged limitations.
- Future research could benefit from more quality data, plotting average fantasy points against median points, and exploring applicability to other sports.
